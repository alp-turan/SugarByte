# Diabetes monitoring mobile application - SugarByte 
## Project overview
This project aims to provide an accesible and comprehensive mobile application (app) for diabetic users to log their blood glucose, carbs eaten, and other factors affecting their overall health. 

Our app, SugarByte, differentiates itself from existing diabetic logbook applications through its implementation of an alert system to notify doctors of at-risk glucose readins, as well as through the app's structured logbook approach. Namely, our simple, comprehensive, and intensive logs allow us to cater to diabetic users at varying risk-levels. 

The database of users and log entries was developed using SQL, and all of the UI and functions were developed using java on IntelliJ IDEA.

## Features of SugarByte
- 3 different logbook types: 
1. Simple: only Blood Glucose and carbs eaten at different times of the day.
2. Comprehensive: Blood glucose, carbs eaten and medication dose (insulin or other) at different times of the day.
3. Intensive: Blood glucose, carbs eaten, type ad dose of medication (insulin or other), food diary, duration and type of exercise, and any other unusual events.

- Calendar page to view all logged entries.
- Alert system that sends an email to the user's doctor if glucose levels recorded are outside of the healthy range.
